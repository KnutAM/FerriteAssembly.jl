# Scaling 
Note that this part just exposes temporary docstrings 
and the interface might change.

**Reminder:** *Might make sense to rename "primary" to "unknowns"?*
*This would go better along with `FESolvers`*

```@docs
FerriteAssembly.scale_primary_global!
FerriteAssembly.unscale_primary_global!
FerriteAssembly.unscale_primary!
FerriteAssembly.scale_residual!
