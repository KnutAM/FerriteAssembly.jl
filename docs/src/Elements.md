# Implemented elements
There are two elements that are implemented directly in FerriteAssembly,
* [AbstractMaterial](@ref)\
  If you have implemented your constitutive mechanical behavior following the 
  [`MaterialModelsBase.jl`](https://github.com/KnutAM/MaterialModelsBase.jl)'s API,
  [`FerriteAssembly.element_routine!`](@ref) and [`FerriteAssembly.create_cell_state`](@ref) 
  have already been implemented for this case. 
* [WeakForm](@ref)\
  For conveniently testing simple single field cases, an element where the weak form can be specified directly is implemented.

## AbstractMaterial
```@docs
FerriteAssembly.element_routine!(Ke, re, state::Vector{<:FerriteAssembly.MMB.AbstractMaterialState}, ae, material::FerriteAssembly.MMB.AbstractMaterial, cellvalues::CellVectorValues, dh_fh, Î”t, cb)
```

## WeakForm
```@docs
FerriteAssembly.WeakForm
```
